## Current Research
- **CASM (Coherent All-Sky Monitor)**: Developing software for beamforming, transient searching, and machine learning–based candidate selection for the [CASM array](https://liamconnorastro.com/casm.html) at OVRO, designed to detect nearby FRBs.

## Previous Work @ Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, Bonn, Germany
- **COMPACT**: Postdoctoral researcher in [COMPACT](https://erc-compact.org/), where I designed a distributed pulsar search engine coordinating multiple HPC clusters worldwide using Kafka for real-time binary pulsar searches.  
  - Code: [one_ring](https://github.com/erc-compact/one_ring)  
  - **ASGARD**: [ASGARD](https://github.com/erc-compact/asgard) is a Nextflow pipeline developed for the COMPACT project to process MeerKAT baseband data from raw SPEAD packets to dedispersed, beamformed, and folded pulsar data products.

## Pulsar Search Contributions
- **Peasoup**: One of the main contributors to [peasoup](https://github.com/ewanbarr/peasoup), a GPU-accelerated pulsar search package supporting acceleration searches and template-bank searches for both circular and elliptical binary orbits.

## Machine Learning
- Developed a [Semi-Supervised GAN](https://github.com/vishnubk/sgan) for pulsar signal classification in radio time-domain data.
